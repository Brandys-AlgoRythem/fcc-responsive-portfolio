# freeCodeCamp - Personal Portfolio Webpage Project (FCC Version)

This project is my first personal portfolio webpage, built as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It's designed to showcase the projects completed during the certification and demonstrate foundational web development skills using HTML5 and CSS3.

The portfolio is responsive, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes, and includes sections for a welcome, projects, and contact links.
